# Resveratrol-Aging-Transcriptome
<!-- Depletion of oocytes and follicles and reduced oocyte quality contribute to age-associated ovarian senescence and infertility. 
Resveratrol acts as anti-oxidant and Sirt1 activator to alleviate aging including reproductive aging. 
It remains elusive whether resveratrol can reprogram the aging epigenome. 
We sought to examine aging ovarian epigenome and the potential effects of resveratrol by combined analysis of transcriptome and methylome in mice oocytes.
Objective: Perform clustering of RNA-seq dataset to examine the potential impacts of resveratrol on the aging transcritpome. -->
